# Timed-JavaScript-Quiz


## Description

- What was your motivation?
    My motivation behind this project was to make a dynamic quiz game that would prompt the user to start a quiz which would start a timer and deduct time when they got the answer wrong. At the end of the quiz, they would be given a score based off of thier time left over and scoreboard would be made from the score and a name that the user would input.  
- Why did you build this project? )
    This project was a chance to practice and apply javascript that I learned in class. 
- What problem does it solve?
    During the build of this project, I had to solve the problem of going from a user start screen which introduced the game, to then to cycle through questions and store a value in local storage then retieve the value and apply it to my webpage.  
- What did you learn?
    I learned how to make a page dynamic by hiding parts of my HTMl and populating elements on my HTML from my Javascript, although I wasnt able to get my Javascript to populate more than the first question, I tried several approaches, I attempted a while loop as well as a forEach loop each of which were not successful. I learned how to store values into local storage. 


## Usage

The user clicks on the start button and they are then prompted with a question, at the end of the game, they submit thier name.
